# Coursework-2-Question-4
Similar to Coursework-2-Question-3, this project uses class files from the previous 2 projects. The difference here is that this project finds the best DISCONTINUOUS PIECEWISE polynomial approximation to a function in the 2-norm.
The class LocalBestL2Fit is derived from AbstractApproximator, and uses a constructor similar to that of BestL2Fit in Coursework-2-Question-3, but also takes the number of subintevals for integration.
Again the Matrix and Vector files are NOT mine.
The driver file is and example of how the code is used, and performs approxiations on four functions.
